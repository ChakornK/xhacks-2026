## Inspiration

Finding internships is one of the biggest challenges students face today. We realized there is a major disconnect: students have the skills from their rigorous SFU coursework, but they struggle to translate that experience and their resumes into industry-ready language. Many students don't know how to map their academic background to actual live job listings in Vancouver and across BC. Therefore, we built SFU CareerConnect to bridge this gap between academic transcripts and the professional world.

## What it does

CareerConnect is our AI-driven career strategist.

1. Users select their completed SFU courses and upload their resume.
2. Leveraging Gemini AI, the app analyzes academic trajectory and suggest roles.
3. The platform actively scrapes the LinkedIn Jobs API to provide live data on current openings specifically within Vancouver and the broader British Columbia region.
4. The system performs a "Skill Insights" audit, identifying the user's professional identity and highlighting critical skill gaps. It uniquely maps competencies back to specific SFU courses or research projects, providing a clear lineage for every strength.
5. A detailed analysis that identifies your unique professional identity and highlights skill gaps. It provides a breakdown of your top competencies and links them back to their original sources, such as specific SFU courses or research projects, so you can see exactly where your strengths come from.
